                    participant.
                    GSoC came as an option for summer industrial
                    training. My 4th year as a Computer Science

                    Contributing to an Open Source project throughout the

                    as a GSoC participant.

                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                  </div>

                  <p>
                    I had an aim to get selected as a GSoC participant
                    this year and contribute to some Open Source project. So, I
                    started early. Just after the Google announced list of accepted
                    mentor organizations, I started searching for one. The aim
                    was to select a project suitable to my skills and interests.
                    Luckily, I stumbled upon project <b>Jangouts</b> under the
                    organization
                    <a href="https://www.opensuse.org/"
                       target="_blank">
                       openSUSE
                    </a>.
                  </p>

                  <br />

                  <div class="post-title">
                    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
                  </div>

                  <p>
                    I believe that the most difficult part in GSoC is to select
                    a suitable project and getting started as a contributor.
                    But, when you're with <b>openSUSE</b>, things are different. I found
                    it comparitively easy to get started with the projects under
                    <b>openSUSE</b>. Their
                    <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:GSoC"
                       target="_blank">
                       GSoC Portal
                    </a>
                    was full of information and guidelines for beginners. You
                    can find everything starting from last year GSoC ideas to
                    proposal template, everything is available. You can also
                    contact people there for more info.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    As far as my own experience is concerned, I thoroughly went through the
                    articles at <b>openSUSE</b> GSoC portal, whenever I required
                    throughout the GSoC.
                    I visited the
                    <a href="http://101.opensuse.org/gsoc/"
                       target="_blank">
                       openSUSE 101 mentoring site
                    </a>
                    for information on this years projects. There, I found
                    <b>Jangouts</b> and decided to contribute to the project.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    First task was to build the <b>Jangouts</b> and <b>Janus
                    gateway</b> on my local machine. I joined <b>#jangouts</b>
                    on IRC for getting some help from the Jangouts team of contributors.
                    Building Janus gateway was easy part, but, running Jangouts
                    local instance was difficult and tricky. My mentors
                    <a href="https://github.com/ancorgs"
                      target="_blank">
                      Ancor
                    </a>
                    and
                     <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/imobachgs/"
                      target="_blank">
                      Imobach
                    </a>
                    helped me out a lot in this task. Finally,
                    our combined efforts paid off, and, I was successful in
                    building and running a local Jangouts instance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now, I had to start contributing some code to the
                    <a href="https://github.com/jangouts/jangouts"
                       target="_blank">
                       Jangouts repository on Github
                    </a>.
                    For that, I visited openSUSE mentoring repository and
                    started looking into related
                    <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/mentoring/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AJangouts"
                       target="_blank">
                      issues
                    </a>. There, in the conversations, I read about
                    <a href="https://github.com/jangouts/jangouts/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22junior+job%22+is%3Aclosed"
                       target="_blank">
                       Junior Jobs
                    </a>
                    for getting started. So, I started working on these issues.
                  </p>

                  <br/>

                  <h4>TypeError issue</h4>
                  <p>
                    My first Pull request to the project solved a simple
                    bug. While trying to build the Jangouts, I could see in
                    the browser console, that there was some error in reading
                    the Jangouts config file. I found out, that due to TypeError,
                    the local instance was not running. I opened a
                    <a href="https://github.com/jangouts/jangouts/issues/179"
                       target="_blank">
                       TypeError issue
                    </a>.
                    Then I sent a
                    <a href="https://github.com/jangouts/jangouts/pull/180"
                      target="_blank">
                      Pull request
                    </a> adding a typecheck inside <code>replacePlaceholder()</code>
                    function before returning the value in <code>room.service.js</code>
                    file.
                  </p>

                  <br/>

                  <h4>Username Edit Feature</h4>
                  <p>
                    <a href="https://github.com/jangouts/jangouts/issues/15"
                      target="_blank">
                        Username Change Feature
                    </a>
                    was the first Junior Job I worked out. The aim was to
                    allow users in a room to change their names without signing
                    out. The task could be divided into two main parts -
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Updating the name in Feeds object</li>
                    <li>Showing the change to the user</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    First, I designed a UI for name edit. Now the next problem was
                    that, there was no inbuilt support for <code>auto-focus</code>
                    attribute for <code>input</code> tag, hence, I designed a
                    custom auto focus directive <code>autofocus.directive.js</code>.
                    Rest part was to just carry out changes in
                    <code>feeds.factory.js</code> to change the user name in the
                    Feed object. Again, Ancor and Imobach helped me out in this
                    to design a good UI for better UX.
                  </p>

                  <br />

                  <h4>PIN Code Rooms</h4>
                  <p>
                    <a href="https://github.com/jangouts/jangouts/issues/130"
                      target="_blank">
                        PIN Code Rooms Feature
                    </a>
                    was a very exciting feature that I worked on. The aim was to
                    allow users to join PIN protected rooms as configured in the
                    Janus-gateway configs. Earlier, if admin had created a PIN
                    protected room
                    in Janus config, it was visible in the rooms list in Jangouts
                    sign-in page like every other room. But, no one could enter
                    the room, even if they know the PIN, since, there was no way
                    to send PIN in the room-join request. The task could be divided
                    into three main parts -
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Designing a UI at sign-in page to allow user to enter
                    the PIN</li>
                    <li>Sending the pin along with the join request to Janus
                    instance</li>
                    <li>Handling wrong PIN error</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    Here, designing UI was simple. I added the UI in <code>
                    jh-signin-form.html</code> and added the support in
                    <code>jh-signin-form.directive.js</code>. The idea
                    was, that the UI should appear only if the selected room
                    required PIN for entering. The problem was that, there was
                    no such field in rooms list object which Jangouts was receiving
                    from running instance of Janus. So, I had to make a
                    <a href="https://github.com/meetecho/janus-gateway/issues/826"
                      target="_blank">
                      feature request
                    </a>
                    at the Janus-gateway Github repository. Thanks to
                    Lorenzo, I didn't need to add the feature myself. He added it
                     in just 2 days. Next, I had to
                    send the entered PIN in the join request, i.e. inside
                    <code>FeedConnection.register</code> function (inside
                    <code>room.service.js</code>). To access the
                    PIN entered by user, I stored it inside <code>UserService.js</code>.
                    The final part of handling the <code>Wrong PIN</code> error
                    was done in <code>room.controller.js</code>. You can see the
                    related Pull request

                  <h4>Cross-Browser Fullscreen Video support</h4>
                  <p>
                    <a href="https://github.com/jangouts/jangouts/issues/130"
                      target="_blank">
                        Cross-Browser Fullscreen Video Feature
                    </a>
                    was the next feature I decided to work upon. The aim was to
                    allow users to enjoy a fullscreen support for video stream.
                    Earlier, if some user entered a room, and received a video
                    stream of some other participant, there was no way to turn
                    the received video stream to fullscreen mode. The task could
                    be divided into three main parts -
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Accomodating the feature support in the existing UI</li>
                    <li>Adding an event-listener which listened to the fullscreen
                    request by the user</li>
                    <li>Making feature cross-browser compatible</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    First of all, I worked upon adding the event-listener
                    <code>dblclick</code> for toggling fullscreen mode. Then I
                    added cross-browser support by using browser specific prefixes.
                    The changes can be seen in <code>jh-main-feed.directive.js</code>
                    file. But there was a problem here. The <code>video</code> tag
                    inside <code>jh-main-feed.html</code> was being flipped by
                    180 degrees horizontally to neutralize the effect of rotation
                    in the received stream. <code>transform</code> CSS property was
                    being used for this. As the user clicked for fullscreen mode,
                    the <code>transform</code> property no longer worked, and, the
                    video stream was back to rotated mode. This change was easily
                    visible and was annoying from a user's perspective. Thanks

                    suggestion, I wrapped the <code>video</code> tag inside a
                    <code>div</code>, and then applied the <code>transform</code>
                    property. This worked like a charm. You can see the related

                    So, this was all that I did before the GSoC coding period, even,
                    before the GSoC announced the list of selected participants. During
                    all this time, I also worked on two proposals.  Also, I took
                    a break from IRC for around 15 days because
                    of my exams. In between my exams, the Google announced the
                    list of selected candidates. I was very happy to see my name
                    in the selected students' list under openSUSE organization.
                    The proposal that got selected is

                      this
                    </a>. So, now I had to work on project -

                  <p>
                    Directly after my exams, community bonding period
                    started. Community bonding period involved an introduction to
                    the callstats.io service by the
                    <a href="https://callstats.io/"

                    team. This introduction was carried out in a video conference
                    in which I and Ancor participated from Jangouts side, and,

                    participated from callstats side. Other than this, mostly, I
                    worked upon getting a good understanding of the callstats.io
                    object based API during the community bonding period, and, also
                    tried to find out the places in the Jangouts code-base where
                    callstats object based API calls were to be put.

                  <p>
                      Above this para, is a shloka from Holy Bhagwad Gita.
                      The meaning of the shloka is â€”
                      <b>'You have the right to work only but never to its fruits.
                      Let not the fruits of action be your motive, nor let your
                      attachment be to inaction.'</b>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I'll tell you what this shloka has to do with this post.
                    For now let's continue with the real story. So, now exams were
                    over. It was the noon of 3 March 2017, the day of my last mid-semester
                    exam. I had the choice of forgetting about GSoC and try to
                    get some decent intenship offer. I thought deeply for about an hour in
                    silence. My roommates were sleeping so I was not alone, but, there
                    was silence. My actions next were gonna affect my future. It was
                    difficult to get the answers to all the questions in my mind.
                    'Should I go on with GSoC? There are still 20 days remaining till
                    proposal submission starts. What am I gonna do in just 20 days?
                    Am I worthy enough to be a part of GSoC?' and what not! Then,
                    suddenly I said to myself the same quote from the Holy Bhagwad
                    Gita quotted above in the beginning of this para. Suddenly,
                    nothing seemed more meaningful than this shloka. May be all I could
                    do is to try. I was certain that I'm not bad at trying atleast.
                    So, without further a do, I started something which was totally
                    in my control, the karma (action). I started my laptop almost after
                    a week. I ran my eyes through the list of selected orgs. It took
                    almost 2 hours to choose an organization suitable to my skills.
                    I selected
                    <a href="https://www.opensuse.org/" target="_blank">
                      openSUSE
                    </a>. I went through the
                    <a href="http://101.opensuse.org/" target="_blank">projects list</a>
                    and decided to work on
                    <a href="https://github.com/jangouts/jangouts" target="_blank">Jangouts</a>.
                    I tried to keep out of mind the fear of failure. I did't know
                    whether this was going to be my last try, but, I had no hope
                    of getting selected anymore. I kept on telling myself is
                    that I'm going to give my best, rest is up to the almighty,
                    for the action was in my hand and the results were in his.

                  <p>
                    The title is very strange but soothing. There is an irony
                    in what happened and the things to come. Earlier, I was
                    confident enough of me getting selected. I had already started
                    watching dreams of being a GSoCer. In some sense, I tried to
                    imagine the future. This illusion was strong enough to give
                    me a huge boost to jump into the race for getting what I
                    wanted. But at the same time, when things seemed different
                    than the dream, I easily lost hope. I thought I was fighting
                    for my dream, but I ignored the reality, the ultimate truth
                    per se. It was not bad to watch dreams, but, it
                    was not good to ignore the possibility of loss. We all do this
                    in some sense or the other. The important thing was that,
                    only when I submitted my self to
                    the reality, and, decided to do what I could, I was able to
                    get that self satisfaction, because, for now I knew, that even
                    if I would fail this time, I shall not stop trying. Although
                    this time the things were a bit clearer, yet I'd realised
                    that the life is unpredictable and unknown, and hence, I decided to
                    embrace 'the unknown'.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For next 20 days, I did all I could. I had a lot of conversations
                    with the project admin and the contributors on IRC. It was
                    difficult to get started. I tried to contribute patches every day.
                    Everyday, I used to dig up the code base more and more and
                    solve the issues on github. I used to sit for long hours
                    continously. I had to do a lot of things simultaneouly. For
                    example, I had to decide the project for my proposal. I selected
                    one of the summer projects. To write a good proposal, one needs
                    to have a clear understanding of how one's planning to achieve
                    the goal of completing project in time. For that, one needs
                    to get a good understanding of the prerequisites of the project.
                    I also had to learn from scratch a few JavaScript frameworks,
                    which were completely new to me. It was tiresome, but, I had to do it.
                    Then came the proposal submission period. I worked on the
                    proposal and at the same time, continued my contributions to
                    the project. It felt like competing with no one, but myself, for I
                    had no time to look what others were doing. Just 3 days before
                    deadline, the project admin asked me to prepare a new proposal
                    on some other summer project which was recently included in the
                    projects list. I literally had no idea what the project was
                    all about, but I agreed and also asked for his help, to which
                    he agreed. Finally, I was able to submit two proposals.
                    That's how it went on for next 22 days till April 25
                    2017. I wanted to contribute more but the end-semester exams were near.
                    I told the
                    project admin about my exams, to which he wished me good luck!
                  </p>

                  <div class="post-title">
                    <h2>The happy beginning...</h2>
                  </div>

                  <p>
                    You've guessed from the title, huh! Let's continue just
                    for sake of completion.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <b>"I don't want to see you here until your exams are over!"</b>
                    (add a smiley to it). These were the words of my mentor on IRC
                    in reply to my thanks for selecting
                    me for the GSoC. This happened in the middle of my end-semester
                    exams. So, what now? I had finally achieved what I
                    wanted! But I knew that there was still a lot to come. It was not the
                    ending at all, but a beginning of something 'unknown'. I had no idea how
                    'Work From Home' works. "How am I gonna work on
                    a project which is completely new to me? Am I going to pass all the
                    evalauations? What if I failed to live up to the expectations
                    of my mentor?" - my mind, once again got flooded with all
                    such questions along with huge waves of mixed feelings.
                    But by then, I knew the answer. "I don't know the future!"
                    - saying this to myself, I continued
                    to prepare for the next exam.
                  </p>

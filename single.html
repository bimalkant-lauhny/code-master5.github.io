                  <p>
                    On May 5, 2017 I got selected as a
                    <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/" target="_blank"
                       data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top"
                       title="All that you need to know about GSOC.">
                       GSOC 2017
                    </a>
                    participant.
                    This was enough to make this year special. It was the end of
                    my 3rd year as a Computer Science undergraduate at
                    <a href="http://nith.ac.in" target="_blank"
                       data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top"
                       title="Visit my college's official website!">
                       NIT Hamirpur
                    </a>.
                    So naturally, GSOC came as an option for summer industrial training.
                    But frankly, it is more than just that for me. Now, since this
                    year's GSOC is coming to an end, I'm going to describe my journey
                    through summers as a GSOC participant.
                  </p>

                  <div class="post-title">
                    <h2>The very beginning...</h2>
                  </div>

                  <p>
                    My dream to be a GSOCer started somewhere around early 2016.
                    In our college, some seniors who were a part of GSOC that year
                    decided to introduce us to this programme and Open Souce world. I was not
                    aware of any of these. These seniors were highly respected by juniors.
                    So naturally, as a complete beginner, it was fascinating.
                  </p>

                  <div class="post-title">
                    <h2>It's really difficult to get started...</h2>
                  </div>

                  <p>
                    At the end of my summer vacations, around early August 2016, I decided to search for a
                    suitable Open Source organization. I wanted to get a kick start as a
                    contributer in any Open Source org, previoulsy selected into GSOC.
                    It seemed really difficult. There were a hell lot of things which
                    were daunting. Firstly, my 2nd year had just ended, and all I'd
                    done was Competitive Programming (and the worst thing is that, I still feel
                    just a beginner in that!). No knowledge of softwares, framworks and languages (only C++, you see!),
                    team work, version control systems like Git and other stuff ( so, now I guess I'm eligible to
                    be called a complete beginner!).
                    Somehow, I selected <a href="https://dlang.org/" target="_blank">D Lang</a> org. I visited
                    it's last year GSOC projects
                    <a href="https://wiki.dlang.org/GSOC_2016_Ideas" target="_blank">page</a>.
                    I don't remember why, but improving the
                    D garbage collector seemed appealing (I must admit it was
                    too overwhelming to be a begginer project.)
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Now, the aim was clear (atleast, it seemed like that!). I had
                    to learn core D concepts and get a good understanding of Compiler
                    Design (which itself is an undergrad course!). So, things were
                    not easy here. But I had almost 8 months, so no worries. I used
                    to read a lot about D programming and Compiler Design core concepts.
                    This continued till late Semptember 2016.
                  </p>

                  <div class="post-title">
                    <h2>The phase of Identity Crisis...</h2>

                  <p>
                    OK. I accept that the title is a bit cliched, but bear with me till
                    the end of the post. You'll understand why it is so.

                  <p>
                    You guessed right, I left the idea of contributing to the D Lang org. I
                    realised how bad I was in Compiler Desing. But D Lang was fabulous. No offence,
                    I really love C++, because it was the very first programming language
                    I learned and I was mesmerized at the thought of possibilities.
                    But I must admit, that D Lang is - <b>how I wanted C++ to evolve!</b>.
                    That's certainly my personal opinion, but, I would like to suggest you
                    to just give it a try.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Things were becoming bad for me. Companies had started visiting
                    our campus for 3rd year internships. Some of my friends got
                    selected for summer internships. Some of my them had started contributing
                    to Open Source orgs (Hey! I was not jealous. I was just feeling like a loser).
                    I thought "A complete waste of two months precious time!".
                    Then one of my friends suggested me to
                    select a new org with C++ as a required language. He told me that I was
                    good in C++ so, it would help me to get the 'expected start'!.
                    I did what he said. I selected <a href="https://www.kde.org/">KDE</a>
                    this time. Things went a bit further than earlier, and I chatted with some of
                    the contributers on IRC. I was also able to successfully build
                    <a href="https://marble.kde.org/">Marble</a>, a KDE product. Now, I had to learn
                    <a href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/">Qt 5</a> for Marble android. Things were
                    going smooth. I had started making androind apps in Qt 5.
                    Remember the title of this para? yeah, I was still suffering from that.
                    So guess what, at mid November 2016, I changed my mind. I again left KDE.
                    I didn't know what kind of start I was expecting. I just kept on
                    thinking that this was not something I wanted. For the first time in my life,
                    I wanted to take a break from coding.
                  </p>

                  <div class="post-title">
                    <h2>Not the kind'a break you expected...</h2>
                  </div>

                  <p>
                    Yes, you read the title right. It turned out to be a different break than
                    one expected.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Our End-Semester Exams were approaching. Due to the bad phase, I was
                    in no mood of studying for exams. But, I thought, if I would not score
                    good this semester, it would really break me. Since I was already
                    feeling like a loser for not yet deciding the org in which I wanted
                    to contribute. I didn't even wanted to think about this, because it
                    reminded me of my utter failure, let alone contribution. So, yes, I
                    tried to study course related subjects (one of which was Compiler
                    Design). This lasted till mid December 2016. After exams, I was
                    at the college for few days. My roommate, who was already a
                    top contributor in <a href="https://fossasia.org/">FOSSASIA</a> by then,
                    also stayed there. I used to see him contribute with all his might.
                    I also wanted to contribute, but I didn't had the courage to start
                    all again.
                  </p>

                  <div class="post-title">
                    <h2>And that's how I started Web Development...</h2>
                  </div>

                  <p>
                    I went home during winter holidays (only around 20 days).
                    Now, I had decided to keep GSOC out of my mind. At that time,
                    GSOC seemed not so safe option. I decided to dive into Web Development .
                    One reason for doing this was that, I was totally inspired by my friend.
                    His work was in FOSSASIA was Web related stuff (especially, backend).
                    The other reason was that, I wanted to get atleast an internship somewhere for
                    summer industrial training. So getting one as a Web Developer
                    seemed appealing (What other choices I had!). Now, only 4 and a half
                    months were remaining for my summer vactions to start. I wanted
                    to build a good background in Web Development before applying
                    for position of an intern. I asked my roommate for some guidance
                    on getting started. He suggested some good websites and learning materials.
                    Suddenly at home, I could feel a new excitement. I was going to learn
                    something new, yet, very common topic. I was excited to learn how
                    the internet works, how websited are so user friendly and all
                    that stuff. So, I started with full vigour and enthusiasm. I started
                    with some frontend projects and dived deeper into the unknown realms
                    of functional programming in JavaScript. This was amazing. Once again,
                    I was reliving that feeling of awe and amazement that I had when I first started
                    writing programs in C++. I totally forgot about the GSOC and the related
                    failures. Event the thought of getting an internship, because of which I
                    started learning Web Development, did not strike my mind even once during
                    the holidays. I was so engulfed by the peculiarities and strangeness of
                    JavaScript, that I didn't realise when my holidays came to a hault.
                  </p>

                  <div class="post-title">
                    <h2>Back to college...</h2>
                  </div>
                  <p>
                    Now that my holidays had ended, I was back in college. I took
                    only a few days to become aware of that same environment surrounded by the familiar
                    air of the tensions and worries regarding my near future. By this time,
                    I had already started focussing on Node.js (a JavaScript based backend framework).
                    Some people take a lot of time in chosinf a backend framework.
                    For me, it was easy. I wanted to play more and more with JavaScript, so,
                    Node.js was an obvious choice.

                  <p>
                    On May 5, 2017 I got selected as a
                    <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/" target="_blank"
                       data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top"
                       title="All that you need to know about GSoC.">
                       GSoC 2017
                    </a>
                    participant.
                    This was enough to make this year special. It was the end of
                    my 3rd year as a Computer Science undergraduate at
                    <a href="http://nith.ac.in" target="_blank"

                    </a>.
                    So naturally, GSoC came as an option for summer industrial training.
                    But frankly, it is more than just that for me. Now, since this
                    year's GSoC is coming to an end, I'm going to describe my journey
                    through summers as a GSoC participant.

                  <p>
                    My dream to be a GSoCer started somewhere around early 2016.
                    In our college, some seniors decided to introduce us to GSoC
                    programme and the world of Open Souce. I was not aware of
                    any of these.
                    These seniors were GSoC participants that year.
                    and were highly respected by juniors.
                    So naturally, as a complete beginner, it was fascinating.
                  </p>

                  <div class="post-title">
                    <h2>It's really difficult to get started...</h2>
                  </div>

                  <p>
                    At the end of my summer vacations, around early August 2016, I decided to search for a
                    suitable Open Source organization. I wanted to get a kick start as a
                    contributer in any Open Source org, previoulsy selected into GSoC.
                    It seemed really difficult. There were a hell lot of things which
                    were daunting. Firstly, my 2nd year had just ended, and all I had
                    done was Competitive Programming (and the worst thing is that, I still feel
                    just a beginner in that!). No knowledge of softwares, frameworks and languages (only C++!),
                    team work, version control systems like Git and other stuff ( so, now I guess I'm eligible to
                    be called a complete beginner!).
                    Somehow, I selected <a href="https://dlang.org/" target="_blank">D Lang</a> org. I visited
                    it's last year GSoC projects
                    <a href="https://wiki.dlang.org/GSoC_2016_Ideas" target="_blank">page</a>.
                    I don't remember why, but improving the
                    D garbage collector seemed appealing (I must admit that it was
                    too overwhelming to be a beginners' project.)
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Now, the aim was clear (atleast, it seemed like that!). I had
                    to learn core D concepts and get a good understanding of Compiler
                    Design (which itself is an undergrad course!). So, things were
                    not easy here. But I had almost 8 months, so no worries. I started
                    reading a lot about D programming and Compiler Design core concepts.
                    This continued till late Semptember 2016.

                    <h2>The phase of Identity Crisis...</h2>
                  </div>
                  <p>
                    OK. I accept that the title is a bit cliched, but bear with me till
                    the end of the post. You'll understand why it is so.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    You guessed right, I left the idea of contributing to the D Lang org. I
                    realised how bad I was in Compiler Design. But D Lang was fabulous. No offence,
                    I really love C++, because it was the very first programming language
                    I learned and I was mesmerized at the thought of possibilities.
                    But I must admit, that D Lang is - <b>how I wanted C++ to evolve!</b>.
                    That's certainly my personal opinion, but, I would like to suggest you
                    to just give it a try.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    OK, back to the story. Things were becoming bad for me. Companies had started visiting
                    our campus for 3rd year internships. Some of my friends got
                    selected for summer internships. Others had started contributing
                    to Open Source orgs (Hey! I was not jealous. I was just feeling like a loser).
                    I thought - "What a complete waste of two months' precious time!",
                    since I had started earlier that a lot of others, yet I was nowhere.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A few days later, one of my friends suggested me to
                    select a new org with C++ as a required language. He told me that I was
                    good in C++ so, it would help me to get the 'expected start'!.
                    I did what he said. I selected <a href="https://www.kde.org/">KDE</a>
                    this time. Things went a bit further than earlier, and I chatted with some of
                    the contributers on IRC. I was also able to successfully build
                    <a href="https://marble.kde.org/">Marble</a>, a KDE product. Now, I had to learn
                    <a href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/">Qt 5</a> for Marble android. Things were
                    going smooth. I had started making androind apps in Qt 5.
                    Remember the title of this para? yeah, I was still suffering from that.
                    So guess what, at mid November 2016, I changed my mind. I again left KDE.
                    I didn't know what kind of start I was expecting. I just kept on
                    thinking that this was not something I wanted. For the first time in my life,
                    I wanted to take a break from coding.
                  </p>

                  <div class="post-title">
                    <h2>Not the kind'a break you're expecting...</h2>
                  </div>

                  <p>
                    Yes, you read the title right. It turned out to be a different
                    break than the one I expected, and, of course, a lot different
                    than what you're expecting.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Our End-Semester Exams were approaching. Due to the bad phase, I was
                    in no mood of studying for exams. But, I realised, if I would not score
                    good this semester, it would really break me from inside. I was already
                    feeling like a loser for not yet deciding the org in which I wanted
                    to contribute. I didn't even want to think about it, because it
                    reminded me of my utter failure, let alone contribution. So, yes, I
                    tried to study course related subjects (one of which was Compiler
                    Design). This lasted till mid December 2016. After exams, I was
                    at the college for few days. My roommate, who was already a
                    top contributor in <a href="https://fossasia.org/">FOSSASIA</a> by then,
                    also stayed there. I used to see him contribute with all his might.
                    I also wanted to contribute, but I didn't had the courage to start
                    all again.
                  </p>

                  <div class="post-title">
                    <h2>And that's how I started Web Development...</h2>
                  </div>

                  <p>
                    I went home during winter holidays (only around 20 days).
                    Now, I had decided to keep GSoC out of my mind. At that time,
                    GSoC seemed not so safe option. I decided to dive into Web Development .
                    One reason for doing this was that, I was totally inspired by my friend.
                    His work in FOSSASIA was Web related stuff (especially, backend).
                    The other reason was that, I wanted to get atleast an internship offer for
                    summer industrial training. So getting one as a Web Developer
                    seemed appealing (What other choices I had!).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now, only 4 and a half
                    months were remaining for my summer vactions to start. I wanted
                    to build a good background in Web Development before applying
                    for position of an intern. I asked my roommate for some guidance
                    on getting started. He suggested some good websites and learning materials.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At home, I could feel a new excitement. I was going to learn
                    something very common, yet, totally new to me. I was excited
                    to learn how the internet works, how websites are so user friendly and all
                    about the internet. So, I was full with vigour and enthusiasm. I started
                    with some frontend projects and dived deeper into the unknown realms
                    of functional programming in JavaScript. It was amazing. Once again,
                    I was reliving that feeling of awe and amazement that I had, when I had
                    written my first few programs in C++. I totally forgot about the GSoC and my
                    failures associated with it. Even the thought of getting an
                    internship, because of which I started learning Web Development,
                    did not strike my mind even once during
                    the holidays. In between, the results of the semester were announced.
                    And this time I scored the lowest CGPI out of all the semesters.
                    The result was not good. But thankfully, I was preoccupied with learning
                    Web Development, so, it didn't affect me much (although, now it does!).
                    I was so engulfed by the peculiarities and strangeness of
                    JavaScript, that I didn't realise when my holidays came to a hault.
                  </p>

                  <div class="post-title">
                    <h2>Back to college...</h2>
                  </div>

                  <p>
                    Now that my holidays had ended, I was back in college. I took
                    only a few days to become aware of that same environment surrounded by the familiar
                    air of the tensions and worries regarding my near future. By this time,
                    I had already started focussing on Node.js (a JavaScript based backend framework).
                    Some people take a lot of time in chosing a backend framework.
                    For me, it was easy. I wanted to play more and more with JavaScript, so,
                    Node.js was an obvious choice. But this time, it was not like holidays.
                    Although I was enjoying Node, yet the added heaviness of the strainous
                    environment and the realization that my academics also suffered previous semester,
                    were not letting me fully enjoy. I was happy for my
                    friends who were getting selected for interns, but, at the same
                    time I was worried for my future.

                    The title of this para aptly suggests my condition at that time.
                    I had to get an internship offer. I wanted to get rid of the
                    the thoughts filled with tension and guilt for not starting Web
                    Development earlier and grades, ugghh. But luckily, my friends were always there
                    to light me up (no, not with a matchstick! but with their jokes and laughs).
                    They were a true source of happiness and joy, the emotions
                    which were less visible at that time. Of course, there were
                    a lot of my friends who were just like me, desperately searching
                    for an internship. So, atleast I was not alone.

                    February 2017 had started. I still had no internship offer.
                    The only good thing was, I had successfully completed
                    some beginner projects in Node. So, now I could add the
                    word "Full Stack Web Developer" into my CV and Resume. I knew,
                    I was still not very good in Node, but there were 3 months left
                    for summer vacations. Also, we get to learn during internship too.
                    So, I started applying for more and more intern positions on
                    <a href="https://internshala.com" target="_blank">Internshala</a> and
                    <a href="https://angel.co/" target="_blank">AngelList</a>.
                    One day, while working on project on Node, I thought of looking
                    into GSoC again. I had some Web Development background. I was
                    good in JavaScript. So I thought, may be this time I might get
                    a better start. Now, I was back to the phase of dreaming.
                    Yes, being a GSoCer was a dream that I wanted to turn into
                    reality. But this time, I was trying to think more practically.
                    So, this time, I asked one of my friend and roomate to help
                    me out in selecting an organization. He was already contributing
                    to an Open Source organization
                    <a href="https://metabrainz.org/" target="_blank">MetaBrainz</a>.
                    This time with his help, I decide to contribute to a not-so-big
                    org which was selected as a GSoC 2016 org -
                    <a href="http://libindic.org/" target="_blank">LibIndic</a>.
                    This was a smaller org, not very famous like KDE or D Lang.
                    But this org was apt place for me as a beginner. After a about
                    a month, on February 27 2017, the Google was going to announce
                    the name of the selected organizations for this years GSoC.
                    I wanted to be ready till then. I wanted to be sure of my
                    future as an internship. So I started with my full devotion.

                  <p>
                    This time, the change in me was visible. I was not hesitant anymore.
                    I frequenly asked questions on IRC from the org admins and contributors.
                    In just a few days, I was suddenly the most active member on IRC.
                    I was successfull in persuading one of the org admins to start
                    working on a side-project for the org. The project was fully
                    in JavaScript (What more I could ask for!). We both started
                    actively working on the side project. The organization had
                    applied for GSoC. My mentor wanted to continue the project with me
                    through the summers. I was finally able to show my talent.
                    Everyone in the org was impressed with me. This was really
                    the 'expected start'.

                  <p>
                    Everything was going fine. Things seemed to be in control.
                    As far as I remember, I had succesfully built a few modules
                    and backend of the website. Mid-Semester exams were going
                    to start from 25 February 2017. The wounds of lower grades
                    in last semester were still fresh. I could not take chances.
                    So, on 22nd February 2017, I told my mentor about my exams.
                    He was kind enough to excuse me for a week or two, till exams were
                    over.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Exams were going satisfactory. Actually, I was least
                    concerned about exams. 27 February was near and Google was
                    going to announce names of the organizations selected for
                    GSoC 2017. With each day passing, nervousness was increasing
                    exponentially. A lot of questions were flooding my mind everyday.
                    What if my org would not get selected? I tried to run away from
                    one possibility that this question addressed. I kept on saying -
                    "All is Well". But somewhere inside, I knew that I was not
                    sure about my action-plan if things went south.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Then came the night of announcement. By now you might've
                    guessed the next thing (You remember the title of this para.
                    Don't you?). Yes, <b>LibIndic</b> was not in the list.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    What happened next was very rare. My legs and hands and in
                    fact the whole body, in that order, were beyond the feeling
                    of sensation. I know that this might not be easy to grasp
                    for some of you, but, believe me, this is actually what
                    happened. It was not only about 7 months of stress, but all other
                    sorts of emotions that I went through. I realised how it feels
                    when you see your dreams shattering in front of you. I knew
                    I was not prepared for this, and, may be that's the worst thing
                    I did on my part.

                    It was hard to get over with. 'Things were going fine.
                    Damn Google! The worst thing was that, this was the biggest
                    GSoC with highest number of organizations i.e. 200. Why not
                    <b>LibIndic</b>?' - all such sorts of thoughts along with
                    an overwhelming number of emotions were swirling in my
                    mind. There were 3 more exams remaining, so, I had to keep
                    my calm and continue. I left everything to the almighty's
                    wish.

                      Above this para, is a shloka from Holy Bhagwad Gita.
                      The meaning of the shloka is —
                      <b>'You have the right to work only but never to its fruits.
                      Let not the fruits of action be your motive, nor let your
                      attachment be to inaction.'</b>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I'll tell you what this shloka has to do with this post.
                    For now let's continue with the real story. So, now exams were
                    over. It was the noon of 3 March 2017, the day of my last mid-semester
                    exam. I had the choice of forgetting about GSoC and try to
                    get some decent intenship offer. I thought deeply for about an hour in
                    silence. My roommates were sleeping so I was not alone, but, there
                    was silence. My actions next were gonna affect my future. It was
                    difficult to get the answers to all the questions in my mind.
                    'Should I go on with GSoC? There are still 20 days remaining till
                    proposal submission starts. What am I gonna do in just 20 days?
                    Am I worthy enough to be a part of GSoC?' and what not! Then,
                    suddenly I said to myself the same quote from the Holy Bhagwad
                    Gita quotted above in the beginning of this para. Suddenly,
                    nothing seemed more meaningful than this shloka. May be all I could
                    do is to try. I was certain that I'm not bad at trying atleast.
                    So, without further a do, I started something which was totally
                    in my control, the karma (action). I started my laptop almost after
                    a week. I ran my eyes through the list of selected orgs. It took
                    almost 2 hours to choose an organization suitable to my skills.
                    I selected
                    <a href="https://www.opensuse.org/" target="_blank">
                      openSUSE
                    </a>. I went through the
                    <a href="http://101.opensuse.org/" target="_blank">projects list</a>
                    and decided to work on
                    <a href="https://github.com/jangouts/jangouts" target="_blank">Jangouts</a>.
                    I tried to keep out of mind the fear of failure. I did't know
                    whether this was going to be my last try, but, I had no hope
                    of getting selected anymore. I kept on telling myself is
                    that I'm going to give my best, rest is up to the almighty,
                    for the action was in my hand and the results were in his.

                    The title is very strange but soothing. There is an irony
                    in what happened and the things to come. Earlier, I was
                    confident enough of me getting selected. I had already started
                    watching dreams of being a GSoCer. In some sense, I tried to
                    imagine the future. This illusion was strong enough to give
                    me a huge boost to jump into the race for getting what I
                    wanted. But at the same time, when things seemed different
                    than the dream, I easily lost hope. I thought I was fighting
                    for my dream, but I ignored the reality, the ultimate truth
                    per se. It was not bad to watch dreams, but, it
                    was not good to ignore the possibility of loss. We all do this
                    in some sense or the other. The important thing was that,
                    only when I submitted my self to
                    the reality, and, decided to do what I could, I was able to
                    get that self satisfaction, because, for now I knew, that even
                    if I would fail this time, I shall not stop trying. Although
                    this time the things were a bit clearer, yet I'd realised
                    that the life is unpredictable and unknown, and hence, I decided to
                    embrace 'the unknown'.

                  <p>
                    For next 20 days, I did all I could. I had a lot of conversations
                    with the project admin and the contributors on IRC. It was
                    difficult to get started. I tried to contribute patches every day.
                    Everyday, I used to dig up the code base more and more and
                    solve the issues on github. I used to sit for long hours
                    continously. I had to do a lot of things simultaneouly. For
                    example, I had to decide the project for my proposal. I selected
                    one of the summer projects. To write a good proposal, one needs
                    to have a clear understanding of how one's planning to achieve
                    the goal of completing project in time. For that, one needs
                    to get a good understanding of the prerequisites of the project.
                    I also had to learn from scratch a few JavaScript frameworks,
                    which were completely new to me. It was tiresome, but, I had to do it.
                    Then came the proposal submission period. I worked on the
                    proposal and at the same time, continued my contributions to
                    the project. It felt like competing with no one, but myself, for I
                    had no time to look what others were doing. Just 3 days before
                    deadline, the project admin asked me to prepare a new proposal
                    on some other summer project which was recently included in the
                    projects list. I literally had no idea what the project was
                    all about, but I agreed and also asked for his help, to which
                    he agreed. Finally, I was able to submit two proposals.
                    That's how it went on for next 22 days till April 25
                    2017. I wanted to contribute more but the end-semester exams were near.
                    I told the
                    project admin about my exams, to which he wished me good luck!

                    (add a smiley to it). These were the words of my mentor on IRC
                    in reply to my thanks for selecting
                    me for the GSoC. This happened in the middle of my end-semester
                    exams. So, what now? I had finally achieved what I
                    wanted! But I knew that there was still a lot to come. It was not the
                    ending at all, but a beginning of something 'unknown'. I had no idea how
                    'Work From Home' works. "How am I gonna work on

                    evalauations? What if I failed to live up to the expectations
                    of my mentor?" - my mind, once again got flooded with all
                    such questions along with huge waves of mixed feelings.
                    I didn't know the answer to every single question,
                    but, by then, I knew the single answer to every question.
                    "I don't know! I'm just going into the unknown..."
                    - saying to myself, I sat down
                    to prepare for the next exam.
